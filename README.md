# Fake News Detection System

## Description
The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning model developed to predict the authenticity of news articles with a high degree of accuracy. The model is designed to analyze various features of news articles, such as textual content, sources, and social media engagement, to determine if the news is genuine or fake.

Key Features:
- Machine learning model: The system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to learn from labeled datasets and make predictions on new news articles.
- High accuracy: The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.92% in classifying news articles as genuine or fake.
- Feature analysis: The system analyzes various features, including textual content, sources, and social media engagement, to identify patterns and indicators of fake news.
- Model evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Features
- Machine learning model for fake news detection
- Achieves 98.92% accuracy in classifying news articles
- Analysis of textual content, sources, and social media engagement
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.11.4)
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/nikitakumari014/Fake-News-Detection-Project.git
2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
- Collect or obtain a labeled dataset of news articles, classified as genuine or fake.
- Preprocess the data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
2. Train the machine learning model:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm and train the model on the training set.
- Optimize hyperparameters and fine-tune the model if necessary.
3. Evaluate the model:
- Evaluate the trained model on the testing set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.).
- Generate a report or visualizations to analyze the model's performance.
4. Use the trained model for predictions:
- Apply the trained model to new news articles or unseen data to predict their authenticity.
- Deploy the model in a web application or integrate it into an existing system as necessary.
